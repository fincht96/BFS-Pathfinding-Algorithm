# BFS-Pathfinding-Algorithm
A simple "Breadth First Search" path finding algorithm written in C++. The code enables the shortest path to be found between 'A' and 'B' on a grid, whilst avoiding the '@' symbols. Each position on the 5x5 grid is represented as follows: 

		0,  1,  2,  3,  4
		5,  6,  7,  8,  9
		10, 11, 12, 13, 14 
		15, 16, 17, 18, 19
		20, 21, 22, 23, 24
